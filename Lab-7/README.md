# Lab-7 - Build, Train, Save, Deploy, and Test a Neural Network Model using Watson Machine Learning 

## Introduction:
This lab will use the MNIST computer vision data set to train a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits. A simple convolutional neural network built using Keras will be submitted to Watson Machine Learning for training. The trained model will be saved in the model repository, deployed, and scored.  

## Objectives:
This lab will be demonstrated by the instructor. The Watson Machine Learning lite service no longer supports the use of GPUs.
